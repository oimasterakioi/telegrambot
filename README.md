# telegram bot
Would you like to create a telegram bot of your own? Are you worrying about you don't have a great server with SSL?

Don't worry, we have a solution for you. Copy `app.js` to a google script project and config the bot with your own token.

If you know a little about Google Script (or javascript because they are very similar), you can write the code!

Remember, if you built your bot, you may open-source it and put [this repo's url](https://github.com/oimasterakioi/telegrambot) in the README (but not forced to do so), that can make more people know this repo.

And, if you don't know what to do, you can also check [this](https://github.com/oimasterakioi/oimasterbot).
